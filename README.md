# Keras Preprocessing

⚠️ This github repository is now deprecated, all Keras Preprocessing symbols have
moved into the core Keras [repository](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)
and the Tensorflow [`pip` package](https://www.tensorflow.org/install). All code
changes and discussion should move to the Keras respository.

For users looking for a place to start preprocessing data, consult the
[preprocessing layers guide](https://keras.io/guides/preprocessing_layers/)
and refer to the [data loading utilities API](https://keras.io/api/data_loading/).
